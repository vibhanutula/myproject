<p id="R">I like running a lot. It is because it gives strength to your legs and it is also a lovely workout. I think it will be painful when you try it at first, but as you practise you will get used to it. Once I had to run 5 times around the tennis court. It surely was painful. But as I was running slowly, it did'nt really matter. Do you know the secret of winning a running race? Well I'll tell you. <br><br><br><br>
The secret is that half way you will have to run slowly. Then after half way, you sprint with the remaining energy. That is the way you overtake the other participants in the race. Well... Now I have told you all everything I know. <br> So GOODBYE!</p>
